## 📝 Tarefas

### 🛠️	Implement Hangman Game Logic

#### Description
Create a Python program that runs a playable Hangman game in the terminal. The game should randomly select a word, accept user guesses, and display progress after each guess.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the user (one at a time)
- Show current progress (e.g., _ _ a _ _ _)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End when the word is fully guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display appropriate win/lose messages

##### Example
```
Word: _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: a
Word: _ a _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 5
... (game continues)
```

### 🛠️	Enhance the Game (Optional)

#### Description
Add at least one enhancement to make your Hangman game more fun or user-friendly.

#### Requirements
Completed program could:

- Show the list of incorrect letters guessed so far
- Allow the player to play again without restarting the program
- Use a larger or themed word list
- Add ASCII art for the hangman
- Any other creative improvement!
